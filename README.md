# Computing Challenge API Reference Documentation 2020
A simpler, markdown version of the 4WC API documentation

Please see the README file within the docs/ directory for information about the API as a whole
and then the specific files within docs/ for information about specific sections of the API.

## Attribution

This documentation exists to make development of the 4WC app easier for those familiar with standard API documentation. 

These docs have a lot less information than the official ones provided by UCLan, but can be used as a quick reference while creating your game.

Written by Cameron Fleming @ Team NaN for everyone.
